Designing a system based on roles alone may result in developers making incorrect and/or unstated assumptions about the goals, motivations, values, etc. of the individuals who will play a given role in the decision situation. Introducing personas into the system design process will help to mitigate this problem by providing developers with richly defined individuals with explicitly stated motivations, values, etc. for whom they can design the system. In other words, personas will help us to link the system design to the goals of its users, hopefully resulting in a design that is relevant to the users and a more satisfying user experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,
