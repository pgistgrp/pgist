To install PGIST application, please follow the next steps.


1.Make sure JDK and Apache Ant is installed on your system.
  Get the JDK from sun home page.
  Get the Ant binary package from http://ant.apache.org/.
  Install JDK and make the java command available.
  On linux, unpack it, and copy to somewhere you like, and add the following lines to /etc/Profile:
  
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_04
  export ANT_HOME=/path/to/apache-ant
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH
  
  You may want to relogin to enable the environment variables or use "source" command to enable them temporarily.
  
  Test and make sure the commands javac/java/ant work.
  
2.Get the source codes from PGIST server.
  There's a trick to get the source. For security reason, the CVS server is protected by SSH. So you have to create a SSH tunnel
  to access the CVS server.
  Under linux, you can simply use the following command to create a tunnel:
  
  ssh -2 -N -f -L 2401:localhost:2401 username@serverIP
  
  The server IP is: 128.95.212.210.
  
  After the tunnel is created, checkout the source codes:
  
  cvs -d:pserver:username@localhost:/data/cvsroot/repository1 login
  cvs -d:pserver:username@localhost:/data/cvsroot/repository1 co pgist
  
3.Install PostgreSQL
  A relational database is required for PGIST. Currently we are using PostgreSQL 8.1 (http://www.postgresql.org), however you can use MySQL/SQL Server/DB2/Oracle
  as you want. The limit is that the database have to be supported by Hibernate (http://hibernate.org/).
  The codes you checked out from CVS server is configured with PostgreSQL. If you use other databases, don't forget to configure it
  correctly. The configure file is:
  
  $PGIST_SOURCE/src/main/WEB-INF/src/hibernate.cfg.xml
  
  Under linux, modify the /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, let postgresql server listen on '*', that means all connection requests.
  And modify the /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf, let postgresql server accept the connection requests from at least the server where
  tomcat will run on. In my pg_hba.conf it's like:
  
  local   all         all                               ident sameuser
  host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
  
  You need to restart postgresql server after modifying the configurations.
  
  If you use linux, "su -" to switch to root, and then "su - postgres" to switch to postgres user. Now you can use:
  
  psql template1
  
  to login and operate. You need to create a database user for PGIST:
  
  create user pgist password 'password';
  
  The password should match that of hibernate.cfg.xml.
  
  Next you create a database for pgist:
  
  create database pgist owner pgist;
  
  Make sure you can access the database server from the machine your tomcat will run on:
  
  psql -h 192.168.0.1 -U pgist pgist
  
4.Install Apache Tomcat
  Get the binary package from http://tomcat.apache.org/. Unpack and install it.
  
5.Compile the source codes
  With a console, go into the source directory, now you at $PGIST_SOURCE/src. There's an ant build file named build.xml in this
  directory. Open it and modify the line
  
  <property name="tomcat" value="/opt/jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9"/>
  
  to the correct place of your tomcat directory. Check all the above steps are correctly followed, especially the database configurations.
  
  Now comiple the sources with:
  
  ant compile
  ant schema <--- this step will create the database tables
  ant initdb <--- this step will initiate the databases
  
6.Finally, you can start your tomcat server and access with:

  http://localhost:8080/pgist/
  
  Login with the default user admin/admin.
